# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Backtester (with prebuilt simple neural network prediction model)

This project develops a set of functions providing traders with the ability to build and test their trading strategies against historical market data of their choice.

This project also develops a deep learning model to predict future trends in financial markets based on historical data.
The model uses historical price data to forecast whether the price will increase or decrease, helping in making informed trading decisions.

## Project Structure

- `backtest.py`: Script for training the model and displaying its performance in trading.
- `test_data.py`: Script for backtesting the startegy on test dataset.
- `my_model.h5`: File containing the trained model.


## Built With

- TensorFlow/Keras - The deep learning framework used
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - Numerical operations
- Matplotlib - Plotting library
